                <h2 class="sub-head">Care and Maintenance</h2>
                <p> 
                    Your Porsche is built to last you a life time if you should take care of it. It's important to follow the factory scheduled
                    maintence checks and to regularly wash your car. Protective wax and detailing will further ensure the aesthetics and clearcoat are protected
                    for as long as you own the car. Here are some tips!
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3 class="sub-head">Preventative maintence with oil</h3>
                <p>It is important that you follow either the 5000 miles scheduled oil change or with newer models, to check on the auto scheduler.
                    Secondly, it is wise to check oil levels everytime you fill up for petrol. You can quickly check the levels to ensure the engine<br> running optimally.
                </p>
                    
                <h3 class="sub-head">Paint detailing</h3>
                <p>Although your Porsche has a clear coat to protect the underlaying paint job from the elements, it's important to note that with neglience your<br>
                    clear coat can and will detoriate. So it is important to regularly wash, clean, polish, and wax your vehicle.<br>
                    Here is a handy chart for you.
                </p>
                <br><br>

                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Issue</th>
                        <th>Cause</th>
                        <th>Remedy</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Surface feels rough</td>
                        <td>Paint containaments</td>
                        <td>Wash and clay-bar</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Dull paint</td>
                        <td>Oxidation</td>
                        <td>Polish and Wax</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Water does not bead</td>
                        <td>Lacking wax</td>
                        <td>Clean and Wax</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Always be conservative when it comes to auto paint polishing. This will slowly deteoriate your clear coat layer.<br>
                    "A little polish goes a long way" is the saying. You normally should not need to heavily polish your car.<br>
                    We also advise you to stay away from physical car washes as the brushes are often contaminated with soot and debris!
